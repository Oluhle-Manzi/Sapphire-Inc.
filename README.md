2.	Project Description
The CTU-Buddy website was created with the primary end user (City Technical University students) in mind. Students require a space where they can interact and engage with one another, making their learning experience memorable and enjoyable. This website will allow them to do both at the same time! 

2.1	User Needs
Students require a user-friendly website to efficiently examine and manage their academic lives. They require access to relevant information about the university. Students should be able to easily view their weekly class times, subjects, and weekdays. Furthermore, an acquaintance with the CTU-Buddy system's development team is sought. Students will need to have a way to contact the University. Equally important is the facility to exchange learning resources and engage in scholarly discussions within their peer community. 

2.2	Project Goals
Effective time management 

Students will be given a timetable, allowing them to properly manage their academic schedule/progress.

Learning Through Collaboration 

Create an interactive Discussion page where students may post questions, participate in threaded discussions, and receive comments from their peers to foster a strong feeling of community and collaborative learning.

Resource Sharing 

Allow students to post and share educational resources (Share Resources webpage), boosting knowledge exchange and easy access to study materials.

Relationships and Trust 

Through the About Us webpage, provide insights into the purpose and goal of CTU-Buddy, establishing a sense of connection and trust between users and the platform.

Communication and Evaluation

Allow users to contact the development team via the Contact Us page, facilitating “dialogue”.
